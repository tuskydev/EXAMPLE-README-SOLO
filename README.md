# DESCRIPTIVE-TITLE Solo Project 
### A repo made to test Semantic-UI-React's NPM that has a popup modal that display's necessary info.

### Things learned:
* Learned ternary digits: A new way to count with 0, 1, and 2!
* 
* Learned how to combine two personal Solo Projects to make one dynamic project!

### Overall, a productive project which allowed for better understanding of Pop Up Modals.

## Preview of work done:
### Using ternary digits to find all permutations for two bags for a list of **N** length!
